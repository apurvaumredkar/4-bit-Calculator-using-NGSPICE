A 4-bit CMOS Calculator with 8-bit output based on PTM High Performance 16nm Metal Gate CMOS; made in NGSPICE\
4-page research paper was made for this mini-project; included in the repository.\
**Instructions to use**\
Set the input bits A and B in the .cir file.\
Change the value of the operation selector parameter to:\
1 => 4-bit Full Addition\
2 => 4-bit Full Subtraction\
3 => 4-bit Full Multiplication with 8-bit Output\
4 => 4-bit Full Division with Quotient & Remainder\
Run the code in NGSPICE v34 and output will be presented as waveforms.
